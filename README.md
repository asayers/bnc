An RPG based on Brasenose College, Oxford

Use the arrow keys to move and navigate menus. Press `Space` to select a menu item. In the world view, talk to people with `Space`, and press `Esc` to return to the main menu. Press `Esc` in the main menu to quit.

All necessary classfiles are bundled in an executable `.jar`, with libraries included for Windows, Mac, and Linux. The game also requires the accompanying "data" directory to run. If the game doesn't run when double-clicked, fire up the command prompt in the appropriate directory and type "`java -jar bnc.jar`".
